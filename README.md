# PassStrengthCheker
It's a password strength checker that analyzes passwords and estimates crack time. It checks length, character types, patterns, and gives improvement suggestions. "How did you build it?" I broke it into modules: one checks length, another checks character types, one detects patterns, and they combine for a final score and time estimate.
